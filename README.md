## Overview

TriggerBot is an automated color detection tool designed to perform specific actions when a defined color is detected on your screen. The project integrates a powerful PyQt5-based graphical user interface (GUI) to make configuration user-friendly and highly customizable.

Key features include:
- Color-based automation with adjustable RGB and tolerance settings.
- Hotkey support for activation, including custom key bindings.
- Adjustable timing settings for precise control.
- Toggleable dark/light mode for user preference.
- Detailed built-in tutorial for quick onboarding.

## Configuration

### Default Settings
- **Hotkey**: `Delete` (`0x02`)
- **RGB Color**: `(255, 51, 255)` (Purple)
